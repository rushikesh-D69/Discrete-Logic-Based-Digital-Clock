# Digital Clock using Digital ICs (24-Hour Format)

This repository contains the schematic and design documentation for a fully functional 24-hour digital clock implemented using discrete digital ICs. The clock displays hours, minutes, and seconds on 7-segment displays and includes reset logic for full-cycle operation.

## Project Description

This clock circuit uses a combination of CD4026 counter/display driver ICs, a 555 timer for pulse generation, and various logic components to create a real-time digital clock. The display is in HH:MM:SS format using six 7-segment displays. A reset mechanism is included to return the time to 00:00:00 or enable manual adjustment.

## Features

- Displays time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format
- Real-time second counting using 1Hz clock pulse from 555 timer
- Six 7-segment displays driven by CD4026 ICs
- Proper carry-over logic between seconds, minutes, and hours
- Reset and manual set buttons included
- Logic implemented using 7411 AND gates and discrete diodes
- Debounced push buttons and stable power management

## Circuit Overview

- The 555 timer generates a stable 1Hz clock signal.
- CD4026 ICs are used to count and drive each 7-segment display.
- Reset logic is implemented using 7411 AND gates and diodes to reset counters at 60 seconds, 60 minutes, and 24 hours.
- Debouncing capacitors are used with the push buttons.
- A regulated 5V power supply ensures consistent operation.
